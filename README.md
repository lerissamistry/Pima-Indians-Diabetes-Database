# Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Database
This project involves predicting whether a patient has diabetes using the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. The dataset consists of 768 observations and 8 medical features, including Number of Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age. The target variable, "Outcome," indicates whether a patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

The dataset focuses on females of Pima Indian heritage, all aged 21 or older. This binary classification problem aims to use various machine learning techniques to predict diabetes based on these diagnostic measurements.

Key Steps in the Project:
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualised relationships between features and identified key predictors of diabetes.
* Modeling: Trained a Random Forest classification model, to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic.
* Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score and Hyperparameter Tuning.
